Here, I use LESS to create three CSS themes - one Red, one Green, one Blue. Selecting from the drop-down list will change the class of the container to *red", "green" or *blue*.

Within each of these CSS classes are other CSS elements dictating what the child elements of the container should render as. It's heavily nested, which is supported by LESS.

While it is possible to do this without LESS, it would also be far messier. Some LESS functions are also used, such as *darken()* and *lighten()*. There are also LESS variables and mixins demonstrated.
